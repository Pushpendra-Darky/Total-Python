Variables Practice #1
Declare two variables, called name and age.

Set the name variable value to "Tony Soprano" and the age value to 51.


Variables Practice #2
Create three variables:

first_name

last_name

full_name

Assign the value "Julia" to first_name, and for last_name, assign the value "Roberts". Finally, build the variable full_name by concatenating these two variables (remember to add a space in between).

Variables Practice #3
Declare the variable course, assign it the value "Python", and print the following sentence:

You are taking a course course

To do this, you must concatenate the first and last parts of the sentence with the variable. Remember to add spaces before and after concatenating the variable to the rest of the text.
