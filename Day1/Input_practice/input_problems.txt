Write Python code that allows the user to enter their answer, by making them the following question:

What are you learning today?

Your code must be able to print to the screen whatever is entered by the user (use the print function).

Note: So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask you to pay close attention to the text you have to reproduce, nothing more, nothing less. Take care not to overlook spelling and punctuation, and avoid unnecessary line breaks or extra white spaces, or any other of the like for that matter, that can cause unexpected errors that are not always detected by the evaluation module, returning an error in your exercise.

What is your name?
