Collections Module Practice #2
Create a dictionary called my_dictionary, for which, when a searched keyword is not found, it is loaded with the string "Value not found".

Load the dictionary with at least the following data pairs:

keyword = age

value = 44

Use the defaultdict method of the Collections module.


Collections Module Practice #3
A double-ended queue or deque is a linear data structure that allows elements to be inserted and deleted at both ends.

Find out more about it on any documentation site, and then implement a deque from the collections module. The initial elements of the list are provided below.

["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid", "Rome", "Moscow"]

The list must have the ability to incorporate elements from the left, and be named cities_list.
